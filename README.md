# beautiful_soup

You’re now ready to take on a full web-scraping and data analysis project. You’ve learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. You’ve also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

## Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
* Use Chrome DevTools to identify which elements to scrape.
* Create a Beautiful Soup object to extract text elements from the website.
* Store the sraping results in a Python dictionary.

## Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
* Use Chrome DevTools to identify which elements to scrape.
* Create a Beautiful Soup object to scrape data in HTML table.
* Assenble scrappped data into a Pandas DataFrame.
* Answer the following questions:
1. How many months exist on Mars?
2. How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
3. What are the coldest and warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)?
4. Which months have the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?
5. About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year?
* Export DataFrame into a CSV file.
